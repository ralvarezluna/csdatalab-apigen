Participants in this program trial varieties from the Seed Savers Exchange collection and submit feedback on their performance. This information helps us better understand the adaptability of these varieties to different regions and environments and guides our selection process for new introductions into our seed catalog.\r\n\r\nIn early January each year, we release details on the trials we\u2019re offering for the upcoming growing season. Participants select the crop(s) they want to trial and are then randomly assigned three varieties from each trial. In the first week of March, we send out kits to participants containing seeds, plant labels, a field datasheet, and instructions for submitting data. Participants grow the three varieties from each trial side-by-side in their garden. We do not require a minimum number of plants. Participants evaluate each variety on a handful of key characteristics, including yield, flavor, earliness, appearance, and disease resistance. Data is submitted via a web platform called SeedLinked, which also allows users to upload photos, view variety profiles, analyze results, and connect with others in the trials.\r\n\r\nThe performance data on the varieties is valuable in helping Seed Savers Exchange determine which varieties from the collection to make commercially available to gardeners and farmers through its annual seed catalog.

The birds and the trees are mutually dependent on one another: pinyon pines provide pinyon jays with food, and pinyon jays help pinyon pines spread their seeds. Both are facing unprecedented threats. \r\n\r\nThe pinyon jay population has shrunk by an estimated 85 percent since 1967, and the remaining population is expected to experience further declines in the next 50 years. Researchers believe a major reason for the decline is habitat loss. Across public lands in the West, federal agencies are proposing large-scale destruction of pinyon and juniper forests. After machines chew up the trees, the agencies often plant non-native grasses, which are a favorite of livestock.\r\n\r\nWe're looking for volunteers to help gather information about pinyon jays to inform sound management of pinyon and juniper forests in Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument and elsewhere throughout the Colorado Plateau.\r\n\r\nWe're using eBird to document pinyon jay sightings because it is user-friendly and volunteers' data is easily accessible. Additionally, the Utah Division of Wildlife Resources currently downloads eBird data to inform their bird management strategies. The current Conservation Strategy for the pinyon jay, recommends a 500m buffer of undisturbed habitat around known breeding colonies, providing protection for both birds and the pinyon-juniper forests. Thus, if we can document where there are pinyon jays and perhaps even breeding colonies, we can advocate and hopefully prevent large-scale clear-cutting and discourage tree removal altogether in areas full of pinyon jays.", "image_credit": "Marie Read", "grp_web": "", "url": "https://www.grandcanyontrust.org/pinyon-jay-project", "video_url": "", "blog_url": "https://www.grandcanyontrust.org/blog/protecting-pinyon-jays-southern-utah", "twitter_name": "@grandcanyntrust", "facebook_page": "https://www.facebook.com/GrandCanyonTrustAZ", "grp_categorization": "", "topics": [{"value": 11, "label": "Birds"}, {"value": 20, "label": "Animals"}, {"value": 9, "label": "Ecology & Environment"}], "fields_of_science": {}, "practices": {}, "practices_how": "", "search_terms": "GSENM, Grand Staircase-Escalante, Colorado Plateau, pinyon jay, mutualism, symbiotic, pinyon pine, desert, southwest", "difficulty": {"value": 1, "label": "Easy"}, "diy": false, "grp_joining": "", "audience": [{"value": 117, "label": "Families"}, {"value": 116, "label": "Adults"}, {"value": 115, "label": "Graduate students"}, {"value": 114, "label": "College"}, {"value": 113, "label": "High school (14 - 17 years)"}, {"value": 112, "label": "Middle school (11 - 13 years)"}, {"value": 111, "label": "Elementary school (6 - 10 years)"}, {"value": 118, "label": "Seniors"}], "signup_url": "https://www.grandcanyontrust.org/pinyon-jay-project", "prefix_how_to_logged_in": "", "prefix_how_to_logged_out": "", "how_to_join": "Go to our project page: https://www.grandcanyontrust.org/pinyon-jay-project and sign up by clicking the red button.

For more information, please visit www.fairchildgarden.org/gbe or twitter.com/GrowBeyondEarth.\n\nGrowing Beyond Earth (GBE) is Fairchild\u2019s NASA-funded classroom science project designed to advance research on growing plants aboard spacecraft. As NASA looks toward a long-term human presence beyond Earth orbit, there are specific science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) challenges related to food production. GBE is addressing those challenges by expanding the diversity and quality of edible plants that can be grown in space. On Earth, GBE is also improving technologies for gardening in urban, indoor, and other resource-limited settings.\nEstablished in 2015 as a partnership between Fairchild Tropical Botanic Garden and NASA\u2019s Exploration Research and Technology Programs, GBE is now underway in 130 Miami-Dade middle and high schools with a special focus on under-resourced, Title 1 schools. Beginning in 2018, 40 sites have been established outside Miami-Dade, in other Florida locations, and in Ohio, Pennsylvania, Colorado, Utah, New York, Texas, California, and Puerto Rico.\n\nGBE is unique in its focus on real scientific research, enabling student \u201ccitizen scientists\u201d to contribute data toward NASA mission planning. Each classroom receives a Fairchild-designed plant habitat that is analogous to the plant growing equipment aboard the International Space Station (ISS). Fairchild and NASA scientists train teachers to conduct in-classroom GBE experiments, and students then share experimental data online with NASA.\n\nSeveral new candidate plants have been identified for spaceflight through the GBE program. These include varieties of pak choi, cress, and kale that produced greater amounts of biomass than the varieties previously tested in NASA labs. We have observed that some plants can grow under a wide range of classroom environmental conditions, possibly indicating high adaptability and stress tolerance. Some of the best varieties from the 2015-2017 classroom studies are now in experimental trials at NASA Kennedy Space Center. To date 10 student-tested varieties have been selected by NASA researchers to be ground tested at Kennedy Space Center\u2019s GreenLab and in 2019 two of those varieties were tested aboard the ISS.\n\nGBE also provided an opportunity to test a new leaf vegetable harvesting strategy. The new strategy, involving frequent harvesting throughout the life of a plant, was shown to be successful in classrooms during the 2015-2016 school year and has subsequently been implemented on ISS.\nTeacher surveys indicate that GBE is improving STEMinstruction in middle and high schools. The program is uniquely effective in serving groups that are underrepresented in STEM fields, as defined by race, gender, and socioeconomic status. Through the program, students have become more knowledgeable about STEMtopics, more confident when participating in STEM activities, and more interested in STEMcareers. Students are also learning about the dietary importance of fresh vegetables for maintaining health.\n\nThroughout history, plants have been essential to exploration. Today\u2019s space travelers are continuing an ancient tradition, bringing food plants on voyages into new and unfamiliar environments. Schoolchildren can now participate in the next phase of human exploration, helping determine which plants might feed explorers on the way to Mars.", "image_credit": "", "grp_web": "", "url": "http://www.fairchildgarden.org/gbe", "video_url": "", "blog_url": "", "twitter_name": "@growbeyondearth", "facebook_page": "", "grp_categorization": "", "topics": [{"value": 24, "label": "Education"}, {"value": 25, "label": "Food"}, {"value": 3, "label": "Agriculture"}], "fields_of_science": {}, "practices": {}, "practices_how": "", "search_terms": "Growing, Space, Space Gardening, NASA", "difficulty": {"value": 1, "label": "Easy"}, "diy": false, "grp_joining": "", "audience": [{"value": 113, "label": "High school (14 - 17 years)"}, {"value": 112, "label": "Middle school (11 - 13 years)"}], "signup_url": "http://www.fairchildgarden.org/gbe", "prefix_how_to_logged_in": "", "prefix_how_to_logged_out": "", "how_to_join": "Register for the next informational session.", "howto_video": "", "outcomes_label": "", "outcomes_link": "", "time_required": "", "training_materials": "", "classroom_materials": "", "consent_statement": "", "consent_statement_date": null, "participation_tools": false, "participation_prompt": "", "participation_confirmation_message": "", "participation_notification_email": "", "participation_usage": "", "grp_relations": "", "part_of": null, "associated_projects": {}, "associated_tools": {}, "grp_needed": "", "total_expense": "0E-32", "materials": "Materials will be provided.", "gear": "", "mobile_app_url_android": "", "mobile_app_url_ios": "", "mobile_app_url": "", "grp_where": "", "location_type": {"value": "ANY", "label": "Global, anywhere on the planet"}, "entirely_online": false, "on_demand": null, "in_person": null, "regions": null, "regions_description": "", "point": null, "address": "", "city": "", "zip": "", "state": "", "country": "", "other": "", "location_name": "", "location_landuse": "", "location_description": "", "geographic_scope": {"value": 144, "label": "International"}, "united_nations_region": {}, "grp_when": "", "begin": null, "end": null, "project_timing": "", "participation_schedule": "Weekly", "time_per_participation": {"value": 240, "label": "Half hour"}, "year_started": 0, "month_completed": 0, "year_completed": 0, "grp_skills": "", "participation_tasks": {}, "activities": [{"value": 32, "label": "At school"}], "special_skills": "", "indoors": true, "outdoors": false, "grp_data": "", "data_results": "", "data_aggregation": {}, "data_consent": {}, "data_visualization": false, "data_access": {}, "data_quality": false, "metadata_publication_url": "", "data_publication_url": "", "data_license": "", "grp_outcomes": "", "intended_outcomes": {}, "outcome_other": "", "grp_sponsors": "", "university_affiliation": "", "sponsors": {}, "stakeholders": {}, "circuit_id": "", "sustainable_development_goals": ""}, {"id": 5809, "legacy_id": 100005809, "box": 95825, "value": "Niger Delta Mangrove Project", "name": "Niger Delta Mangrove Project", "slug": "niger-delta-mangrove-project", "link": "/niger-delta-mangrove-project", "type": "Project", "options": {}, "publish": true, "created": 1608871673625.7688, "updated": 1611247128937.133, "component": "ss-project", "members_only": false, "tags": ["climate", "mangroves", "niger delta", "stubb creek"], "_metadata": "", "image": "https://orrery-media.s3.amazonaws.com/attr/2020-12/Mangrove_planting_TRCC.jpg", "references": [], "grp_scistarter": "", "duplicate": false, "ignore_authoritative": false, "redirect": "", "subcomponent": "", "form": null, "guid": "1fad5416-a200-56c5-a2e0-b769c0ff19c1", "opengraph_description": "", "participation_degree": {"value": 1, "label": "Collegial"}, "is_test": false, "is_affiliate": false, "is_inaturalist": false, "inat_project_id": 0, "participant_instructions": "", "participant_instructions_email": "", "participant_files": {}, "grp_admin": "", "draft": false, "status": {"value": 1, "label": "Active"}, "promotion_time": {"value": "ANYTIME", "label": "Promote at any time"}, "promotion_target": null, "grp_contact": "", "grp_project": "", "us_federally_funded": false, "presenter": "Tropical Research and Conservation Centre(TRCC).", "goal": "Restoration and sustainable management of the Niger Delta mangrove forest", "task": "Tree planting,community education", "description": "Tropical Research and Conservation Centre (TRCC), has a project on public education, participatory learning, restoration and sustainable management of the Niger Delta mangroves adopting the participatory/citizen science approach. Nigeria has extensive mangrove forests in the coastal region of the Niger Delta, considered one of the most ecologically sensitive regions in the world. About 70% of the Nigerian mangrove ecosystem falls within the Niger Delta region. The Niger Delta is located in the Atlantic coast of Southern Nigeria and cuts across nine states. The site falls under the Niger Delta wetlands region of Nigeria, Considered a global biodiversity hotspot. The mangrove swamp of Niger Delta covers an area of is considered a global biodiversity hotspot. The Niger Delta basin occupies the Gulf of Guinea continental margin in equatorial West Africa, between latitudes 3\u00b0 and 6\u00b0 N and longitudes 5\u00b0 and 8\u00b0 E.). Niger Delta mangroves together with the creeks and rivers are a major source of food and livelihood for millions of people ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niger_Delta_mangroves). The Niger Delta mangroves perform all four categories of ecosystem services identified in the Millennium Ecosystem Services report: regulating, provisioning, cultural, and supporting services. These include atmospheric and climate regulation, flood and erosion control, wood and forest crops for cooking fuel, construction, and traditional medicine, nutrient cycling, and habitat for fish nurseries. This ecosystem also plays important role in climate change mitigation because of its high blue carbon sequestration potential. This is particularly important because of continuous gas flaring in Niger Delta from petroleum operations, which releases carbon dioxide among other gases into the atmosphere. Mangroves constitute important nurseries for fishes, crustaceans, sponges, algae and other invertebrates, and also acts as a sink, retaining pollutants from contaminated tidal water. Mangroves are also used as shelter and breeding grounds by mammals, shore birds, reptiles, many insects etc. Unfortunately, this unique ecosystem is on the decline and at the verge of been totally lost. Mangrove forests are affected by oil exploration/exploitation activities, some portions converted to farmlands and the trees are cut for timber, fuel, house construction and so on without restoring. Consequently, many coastal communities in the Niger Delta are losing their lives and primary livelihoods due to increased vulnerability to floods as a result of the disappearance of mangroves which usually serve as defense in times of coastal flooding. They are also now exposed to the high intensity of sunlight and heat waves as the land lay bare of trees to regulate sun rays. Therefore, there is urgent need to restore/conserve the mangroves of the Niger Delta region.\r\nThis project   entails a pilot in one  of the Niger Delta states and will involve community/public education, participatory learning, restoring of degraded portions, local capacity building in conservation practices, experience sharing, data collection, development of management plans and policy review.          It would improve methods and technologies that support the sustainable use of biological resources, identify, promote and support suitable livelihood alternatives among key mangrove dependent.

To ensure sustainable mangrove ecosystem management that encourages community-based participation.\r\n2. To ensure restoration, conservation and management of mangrove wood and non-wood resources on a sustained yield basis; developing effective measures for protection and/or rehabilitation of mangrove ecosystems; mitigating climate change effects in the process.\r\n3. To ensure management and protection of mangrove areas for fisheries, erosion control, coastal stabilization and biodiversity conservation; intensifying the protective function of the mangrove forest along riverbanks, estuaries, and all other marginal forestlands,\r\n4. To increase public awareness and education on the benefits of the mangrove forests; consolidate existing mangrove information and make it available in forms which are meaningful and accessible.\r\n5. To strengthen capacities of the institutions/stakeholders responsible for mangrove management.\r\n6. To promote research and education on conservation and management of mangrove and associated ecosystem.\r\n7.

"description": "Discover and document the pollinator species found on the Arizona State University campuses to aid in pollinator conservation research. Learn more about pollinators by identifying a species and viewing its species profile.\n\nPollinators include insects such as bees and beetles, birds such as hummingbirds, bats such as the Lesser Long-Nosed Bat found in the Sonoran Desert, butterflies, and small mammals. Pollinators provide an important ecosystem service by carrying pollen from flower to flower on their bodies in exchange for a drink of nectar, which helps plants reproduce and bare fruit. One of every three bites of food that you take is provided by pollinators. Their habitat and populations are declining due to factors like climate change, chemical/pesticide usage, and disease. Monitoring their populations, establishing and revitalizing habitats, and overall conservation actions to help ensure their survival is of great importance for all living things.\n\nParticipants will earn credit for contributing at least six different species within the month of April.\n\nPlease share the project with friends and family near campus and have fun! This is meant to be a fun and interesting experience for you, the citizen scientist.\n\nFor additional information and to become more involved, the following links are provided:\nhttps://www.pollinator.org/pollination\nhttps://homegrownnationalpark.org", "image_credit": "", "grp_web": "", "url": "https://www.inaturalist.org/projects/pollinators-of-arizona-state-university", "video_url": "", "blog_url": "", "twitter_name": "", "facebook_page": "", "grp_categorization": "", "topics": [{"value": 12, "label": "Biology"}, {"value": 24, "label": "Education"}, {"value": 16, "label": "Insects & Pollinators"}], "fields_of_science": {}, "practices": {}, "practices_how": "", "search_terms": "ASU, pollinators at ASU, pollinators ASU", "difficulty": {"value": 1, "label": "Easy"}, "diy": false, "grp_joining": "", "audience": [{"value": 115, "label": "Graduate students"}, {"value": 116, "label": "Adults"}, {"value": 114, "label": "College"}], "signup_url": "", "prefix_how_to_logged_in": "", "prefix_how_to_logged_out": "", "how_to_join": "Set up an account using your ASU username, such as johnsmith@asu.edu, but replace the @asu.edu with just \"asu\" so it reads johnsmithasu.
