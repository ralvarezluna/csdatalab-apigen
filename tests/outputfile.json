        "description": "You're invited to join NatureTrackers in monitoring Tasmania's birds of prey (raptors), to update estimates from many years ago. \r\n\r\nIn particular, there are lots of efforts to reduce the impact of human activities on Tasmanian wedge-tailed eagles, but we don\u2019t know if they\u2019re working. These eagles are Endangered, and a different subspecies from the mainland wedgies. Are numbers now increasing - or continuing the suspected decline? \r\n\r\nSpend a day out in May with your eyes to the sky! There's the chance to learn a lot about nature, maps, science and some very special spots in Tasmania. A survey requires six 10-minute periods of observation in your chosen area, each separated by at least 30 minutes: an efficient morning out, or a leisurely day exploring with family and friends. We record all day-active species of raptor during the survey, but it's fine to take part even if you're not yet an expert - you can indicate in your records when you're not sure of the species. \r\n\r\nYou'll need some advance preparation to choose an area (survey square), assemble your team (all ages!) and explore the app or datasheets on which you'll record your observations, but then you're set for a fun morning outdoors - or, for the enthusiasts, as much as two long weekends every May. The website explains what you need to do, including how to book your survey square (usually opening in early February), and resources for you to gain or build on your bird identification skills. \r\n\r\nWhere? Where? Wedgie! also involves a substantial schools component, through Expedition Class: Where Where Wedgie? Students learn about eagles and other birds of prey, and about monitoring threatened species.",

This will give you time to work out how to get there, whether you need any special permission to enter the land, where you'll do each 10 minute observation, and to assemble your team (it's most effective and fun if you have around three of you, although some people prefer to do it alone or in larger groups). Will you head to a remote national park, or visit your friend's property in the Midlands (either would be great - we need more surveys in remote and agricultural areas!).",

        "description": "Adult monarch butterflies, Danaus plexippus, sometimes visit dry or injured parts of certain plants to take up toxic chemicals called pyrrolizidine alkaloids. They do this by regurgitating saliva onto the surface of the plant to dissolve the chemicals, creating a solution that they then suck up using their proboscides. These alkaloids do not provide the butterflies with food or energy. Despite being very poorly documented, this behavior potentially plays one or more important roles in the life history of Danaus plexippus. Better understanding of this curious aspect of their biology could also contribute to successful conservation. More information is provided under Resources.",

These areas are meant to restore or protect parts of the ocean and to function as our insurance policy against ocean change. However, beyond area covered and enforcement, very few are ever evaluated to ensure they are successful \u2014 and the ones that are assessed are typically done on the scale of decades. eMPA is working to capture broad scale social, biological, and anthropogenic trends across MPAs, inside/outside, before/after around the globe in real-time to better inform management decisions and spark new research avenues.",

        "description": "Help researchers explore the drama-filled world of red-headed woodpecker cavities and the animals that use them!\r\n\r\n\r\nRed-headed woodpeckers (Melanerpes erythrocephalus) are a charismatic, easily recognizable bird species of the Midwestern and Eastern U.S. Although they were formerly common throughout their range, they have undergone dramatic regional declines estimated at 67% since 1970. This population decline is presumably due to the loss of preferred nesting habitat in open woodlands and savanna-like grasslands that contain dead limbs and snags for nesting and roosting. And despite their conspicuous nature and former abundance, there is a a lot we still don\u2019t know about their biology and life history \u2013 including nesting ecology, parental behavior, juvenile dispersal and survival, and migration patterns.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn Minnesota, fragmented patches of red-headed woodpecker habitat exist throughout the state, and there is considerable interest and effort to preserve and restore these areas. In particular, land managers are focused on oak savannas, which are now incredibly rare ecosystems throughout the U.S. and are considered to be one of the rarest ecosystems worldwide. Efforts to support red-headed woodpeckers and other oak savanna specialist species through habitat restoration are ongoing at a number of sites, but these initiatives have been challenged by a general lack of information on the factors that make savannas desirable for this species.\r\n\r\n\r\nFortunately, red-headed woodpeckers occur in relatively stable numbers (>100 breeding adults annually) at Cedar Creek Ecosystem Science Reserve in east central Minnesota, which provides a unique opportunity to study an apparently stable population. Building on volunteer monitoring work begun in 2008, a team of researchers led by Dr. Elena West began additional work in 2017 to address key information gaps about red-headed woodpecker ecology. In particular, this work places an emphasis on identifying the aspects of oak savanna habitat that support nest success and survival, habitat use, migration, and movement patterns. \r\n\r\n\r\nThe Woodpecker Cavity Cam sub-project began in 2019 to augment this ongoing research and fill additional knowledge gaps. We are interested in further understanding red-headed woodpecker nesting ecology, with an emphasis on how adult nesting behaviors shape nest success, and how this may be impacted by nest predators and competition by other animals.\r\n\r\n\r\nRed-headed woodpeckers are important primary-cavity nesters\u2014they excavate holes in trees for nesting and roosting. These cavities are also a vital resource for other animals, including bats, squirrels, tree frogs, mice, and secondary cavity nesting birds, like nuthatches, blue birds, and chickadees. These secondary cavity users do not create cavities themselves, but depend on their availability for breeding and roosting. Through the Woodpecker Cavity Cam Project, we hope to gain a better understanding of the animals that use and compete for these cavities and how they use them throughout the year. To do this, we installed a series of trail cameras near red-headed woodpecker cavities to capture the behaviors and interactions of the community of animals that depend on these holes. With your help going through the videos that the cameras capture, we hope to learn lots of valuable new information!\r\n\r\n\r\nAs a volunteer on this project, you will help us quickly identify which of our thousands of videos contain wildlife, which wildlife are featured, and what they are doing. Our project has three nested workflows, or series of tasks, for volunteers to contribute to. Depending on where we are in the process of collecting and uploading videos, one or more of these workflows may be active. You can see the currently active workflows by looking for the labeled buttons halfway down the main homepage. Depending on the workflow you select, you may be helping us sort out videos with wildlife from those without, identifying animals and documenting their behavior, or providing individual-level data on banded red-headed woodpeckers. Each workflow is essential to our project and to our understanding of life at woodpecker nest cavities. Volunteers\u2019 contributions are valuable no matter where they happen! Feel free to work in the workflow that feels the most rewarding to you, and to switch between workflows as often as you like. Make sure to leave questions and comments about things that are confusing \u2013 our team is here to help, and are invested in making sure that you are able to give us the best possible data! \r\n\r\n\r\nYour work is important to the success of the Woodpecker Cavity Cam project, and we\u2019re so happy to have you with us!",

Kitizen Science and this study is open to all people over the age of 18.\r\n\r\nPurpose of this study\r\n\r\nWe collect survey and demographic data so we can understand our volunteers and the experience you bring to Kitizen Science, and so we can compare our volunteer demographics with those of other citizen science projects.  We also track volunteer activity on our website and app, including the total amount of time you spend logged in as a volunteer, the number of cat photo submissions you upload or process, and the route and distance you walk if you volunteer to use our app to conduct cat surveys.\r\n\r\nHow we use this data\r\n\r\nThis data will not be published in a way that makes it identifiable to you as an individual but will be published and shared in discussing our volunteers and how they participate in Kitizen Science.  This includes reporting the average amount of time volunteers spend on Kitizen Science per month, the gender breakdown of our volunteers, and other metrics of engagement and activity.  We also include the routes and distances traveled by app users in the statistical analysis of cat populations.\r\n\r\nRisks and benefits\r\n\r\nOur survey questions are designed to be minimally intrusive, inoffensive, and are not intended to cause stress or place you at risk.\r\n\r\nAlthough this study may not benefit you directly and there is no compensation provided, we appreciate your efforts to support Kitizen Science.\r\n\r\nThe study does not require the collection of any potentially personally identifying information apart from an email address.  Your email address is confidential and will not be published as part of this research.  While efforts are taken to ensure the privacy and security of your responses, in the event of a data breach, your survey answers and other data could be linked to your email address.

IntegReview\u2019s policy indicates that all concerns/complaints are to be submitted in writing for review at a convened IRB meeting to:\r\n\r\nEmail address:\r\n\r\nintegreview@integreview.com\r\n\r\nMailing address:\r\n\r\nChairperson\r\nIntegReview IRB\r\n3815 S. Capital of Texas Highway \r\nSuite 320\t\r\nAustin, Texas 78704\r\n\r\nIntegReview has reviewed the information in this consent form.

Release and Limitation of Liability\r\n\r\nI hereby holds harmless, forever release and discharge Kitizen Science, its officers, directors, agents, volunteers, advisors and/or representatives (collectively, \u201cReleasees\u201d) from, and, further, agree not to sue Releasees for, any and all claims, rights, demands, actions, causes of action, expenses, loss of business or profits, actual, consequential, or incidental damages, fees, and harms of any kind that I may ever have, whether known or unknown, accrued or unaccrued, arising in any way from volunteering for Kitizen Science. This is intended as a general release conferring the greatest protection possible to Releasees. In the event any claim relating to the performance or nonperformance by Kitizen Science or Wild Me pursuant to this Agreement, or in any other way concerning my volunteering activities, is made by me, the actual damages to which such I may be entitled shall be limited to the lesser of the fees paid by me or One US Dollar (US $1).\r\n\r\n6. Indemnification \u2013 Duty to Defend\r\n\r\nTo the maximum extent permitted by law, I agree to defend and indemnify Releasees from any liability, cost or expense, including penalties, losses, damages, litigation expenses, judgments, attorney\u2019s fees, or fines, arising from or resulting from my acts or omissions.\r\n\r\n7. Assumption of Risk\r\n\r\nI am aware of the risk that cats pose to persons, animals, and property, including but not limited to scratches, bites, physical injury, emotional harm, passing of zoonotic diseases, and indirect harm by trying to avoid contact with a feline (e.g., falling, straining, spraining, torqueing). I assume all such risks, and any others that may result in injury to me, my property, my animals, any member of my family or the public, or any property or animals of a member of my family or the public, arising from my volunteer efforts for Kitizen Science.\r\n\r\n8. No Assignment.\r\n\r\nNo party\u2019s rights under this Agreement shall be assigned without the express written consent of Kitizen Science, which consent may be withheld in its sole discretion.\r\n\r\n9. Integration.\r\n\r\nThis Agreement is entered into by me without reliance upon any statement, representation, warranty, agreement, promise, inducement, or document of any kind not expressly contained herein and may not be changed unless in writing signed by Kitizen Science.\r\n\r\n10. Severability.\r\n\r\nIf any portion of this Agreement is held invalid or unenforceable, all remaining portions shall nevertheless remain valid and enforceable, and to the extent it can be given effect without the invalid portions.\r\n\r\n11. Breach and Attorney\u2019s Fees.\r\n\r\nI agree that should I be found by a court of competent jurisdiction to have materially breached this Agreement, the prevailing party shall recover attorney\u2019s fees and costs, including those incurred in satisfying any judgment therefrom.\r\n\r\n12. Venue and Applicable Law.\r\n\r\nThis Agreement shall be governed by and construed according to the laws of the State of Washington. Litigation arising from breaches of this contract shall commence in King County.\r\n\r\n13. Term and Termination of Agreement\r\n\r\nEither party shall have the right to terminate this Agreement at any time by providing notice of termination to the other party in writing. Termination of this Agreement automatically terminates my license to use Kitizen Science\u2019s services, access its cloud database, or any content or any other materials contained therein.",
